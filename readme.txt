WPSSO Core add-on to inherit the featured image and custom images from parents for posts, pages, custom post types, categories, tags, and custom taxonomies.

== Description ==

<p style="margin:0;"><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-inherit-parent-meta/assets/icon-256x256.png"></p>

If no featured image has been selected for a post, page, or custom post type, this add-on will assign the first featured image found from its parent, grand-parent, great-grand-parent, etc.

If no custom Open Graph or Schema image has been selected for a post, page, custom post type, category, tag, or custom taxonomy, this add-on will assign the first custom image found from its parent, grand-parent, great-grand-parent, etc.

The Inherit Parent Meta (aka WPSSO IPM) add-on makes no permanent changes &mdash; simply deactivate the plugin to disable the automatically inherited images. ;-)

There is no add-on settings page for this plugin &mdash; simply *install* and *activate* the plugin.

<h3>Coded for Performance</h3>

The WPSSO IPM add-on uses the WordPress `wp_cache_get()` and `update_meta_cache()` functions for maximum performance and fully integrate with WordPress core functionality.
